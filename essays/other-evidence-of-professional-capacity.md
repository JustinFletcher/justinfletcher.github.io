*This page presents other evidence of my professional capacity in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/#phd-portfolio). This includes all forms of research, teaching, and service to the community and discipline, including professional vita of employment, professional presentations, reviewing of papers for conferences and journals, competitive fellowships or other external funding awards, patents, teaching, service on committees or as graduate student representatives, and letters of reference.*

## Employment

### Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy Portfolio Lead, Special Projects Directorate, Space Systems Command, USSF

### Founding Principal Investigator, the Machine Intelligence for Space Superiority Lab

MISS has executed approximately $15M of government funding since the group was founded in 2017. Funds sources include core and competitive fundings, as well as Air Force Office of Scientific Research grants (totaling $400K).

### Chief Engineer, Maui High Performance Computing Center

### Program Manager, The Dynamic Optical Telescope System

## Advising

### Directed Energy Scholars and Akamai Programs

Supervised serval scholars during 3-month summer internships from 2017-2021. Past scholars include:
* William Mitchell, PhD Student, University of North Texas (2021)
* Kaitlin Dennison, PhD Candidate, Stanford University. (2019, 2021)
* Nikolaus Salvatore, MS, University of Pittsburgh (2020).
* Alex Gao, MS, University of California, Berkeley (2019)

## Research

My role as the lead for the USSF SSC/ECZGA AI and Autonomy project, I directly supervise a variety of research programs. A selection of those programs are described below; only those programs with which I am personally and substantially involved (i.e., directly supervise and/or personally execute) are included.

### SatNet
Designed and implemented a computer vision approach to deep space resident space object detection. 

### SpectraNet
Designed and implemented a computer vision approach to deep space resident space object detection. 

### The Distributed Aperture System for Interferometric Exploitation (DASIE)
Designed and implemented a computer vision approach to deep space resident space object detection. 

### PoseNet
Designed and implemented a computer vision approach to deep space resident space object detection. 

## Selected Professional Presentations

My professional work routine professional presentations. These are far too numerous to enumerate, so I've selected a few that are interesting. This list excludes all archival conference presentations, which are documented under [evidence of scholarly ability](https://justinfletcher.github.io/essays/evidence-of-scholarly-ability.md).
